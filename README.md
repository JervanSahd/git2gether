# git2gether
## Overview
Git2gether exists to connect, equip, and empower coding bootcamp graduates.

Coding bootcamps are a viable career path for aspiring developers.  Graduates of these fast-paced, intensive courses become proficient in a variety of essential technologies and skills to help the graduate become employer-ready.

Upon graduation, many of these very developers are left wondering, “Now what?”  Finding work in this sector proves to be a challenge for many graduates.  Though, as many as 79% of bootcamp graduates say that they landed a job within six months of graduation.<sup>1</sup>

Opportunity is out there, and we want to help developers to find it.  We aim to accomplish this by providing a digital platform to a) locate b) &/or create networking events to meet other bootcamp graduates.

### Events
*In-Person*

Event hosts can arrange local meetups in their areas by filling out the “In-Person Event” form on our website.  Users can search for and find local events by visiting our website.

*Virtual*

Video conference services, like Zoom or Microsoft Teams, provide a convenient way for developers to meet from all over the world.  Event hosts can arrange virtual meetups by filling out the “Virtual Form” on our website.  An online streaming link must be included in the initial setup of the meeting. 

## User Story
